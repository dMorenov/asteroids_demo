## Asteroids Demo
Replica of the classic arcade game Asteroids made in Unity ([Version 2020.3.3f1](https://unity3d.com/es/get-unity/download?thank-you=update&download_nid=64639&os=Win)) by Dani Moreno.

This project was created with the objective to emulate Asteroids under a set of predefined user stories. 

I used Trello to organize tasks, set priorities and have a broader sight. You can [check it here](https://trello.com/b/9zUZo3oJ/asteroidsdemo) although commits will probably grant a better view about the development process.


Documentation about how to manipulate game's settings [can be found here.](Docs/SettingsInstructions.md)
